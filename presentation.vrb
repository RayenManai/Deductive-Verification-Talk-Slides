\frametitle{Proof example}
	"The axioms quoted above are sufficient to construct the proof of properties of simple
programs, for example, a routine intended to find the quotient q and remainder r obtained on
dividing x by y. All variables are assumed to range over a set of nonnegative integers
conforming to the axioms listed in Table I"
The proposed program is:
\center
\begin{lstlisting}
    r = x;
    q = 0;
    while (y <= r) {
	    r = r - y;
	    q = q + 1;
	    }
\end{lstlisting}
